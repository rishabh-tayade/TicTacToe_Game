Hello,
This is a classic tic tac toe game which is a web application.
The basic structure of the web page is done using HTML(file:index.html) with styling done using CSS(file:style.css) and DOM manipulation done using JavaScript.
Please do check the project out and let me know if you have any suggestions on it! Thanks! :)
